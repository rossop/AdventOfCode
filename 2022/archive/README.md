# advent-of-code2022

Afer a few months of very little coding and a lot of writing, this is a great chance to get the Python muscle going and get back in the game. Thse solutions are not optimal and I am likely to go back and revisit them as a learning opportunity. 
If you have any comment please get in contact.

I will repeat the challenge in Clojure after Christmas.
